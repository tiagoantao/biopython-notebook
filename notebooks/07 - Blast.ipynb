    "offered at the time. Unfortunately, the BLAST output in these formats\n",
    "kept changing, each time breaking the Biopython parsers. Our HTML BLAST\n",
    "parser has been removed, but the plain text BLAST parser is still\n",
    "available (see Section \\[sec:parsing-blast-deprecated\\]). Use it at your\n",
    "own risk, it may or may not work, depending on which BLAST version\n",
    "you’re using.\n",
    "\n",
    "As keeping up with changes in BLAST became a hopeless endeavor,\n",
    "especially with users running different BLAST versions, we now recommend\n",
    "to parse the output in XML format, which can be generated by recent\n",
    "versions of BLAST. Not only is the XML output more stable than the plain\n",
    "text and HTML output, it is also much easier to parse automatically,\n",
    "making Biopython a whole lot more stable.\n",

    "it doesn’t matter how the output was generated, as long as it is in the\n",
