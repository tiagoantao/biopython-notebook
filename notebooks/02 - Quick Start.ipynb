All of the examples in this section assume that you have some general working knowledge of Python, and that you have successfully installed Biopython on your system.

      "As mentioned in the introduction, Biopython is a set of libraries to provide the ability to deal with \u201cthings\u201d of interest to biologists working on the computer. In general this means that you will need to have at least some programming experience (in Python, of course!) or at least an interest in learning to program. Biopython\u2019s job is to make your job easier as a programmer by supplying reusable libraries so that you can focus on answering your specific question of interest, instead of focusing on the internals of parsing a particular file format (of course, if you want to help by writing a parser that doesn\u2019t exist and contributing it to Biopython, please go ahead!). So Biopython\u2019s job is to make you happy!\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing to note about Biopython is that it often provides multiple ways of \u201cdoing the same thing.\u201d Things have improved in recent releases, but this can still be frustrating as in Python there should ideally be one right way to do something. However, this can also be a real benefit because it gives you lots of flexibility and control over the libraries. The tutorial helps to show you the common or easy ways to do things so that you can just make things work. To learn more about the alternative possibilities, look in the Cookbook, the Advanced section, the built in \u201cdocstrings\u201d (via the Python help command, or the API documentation) or ultimately the code itself."
