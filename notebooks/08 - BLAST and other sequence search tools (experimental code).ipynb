    "-   The output file may contain results from one or more search queries.\n",

    "-   In each search query, you will see one or more hits from the given\n",

    "-   Some programs like BLAT or Exonerate may further split these regions\n",
    "    into several alignment fragments (or blocks in BLAT and possibly\n",
    "    exons in exonerate). This is not something you always see, as\n",
    "    programs like BLAST and HMMER do not do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Realizing this generality, we decided use it as base for creating the\n",
    "`Bio.SearchIO` object model. The object model consists of a nested\n",
    "hierarchy of Python objects, each one representing one concept outlined\n",
    "above. These objects are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `QueryResult`, to represent a single search query.\n",

    "--------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on to the main functions, there is something you ought to\n",
    "know about the standards `Bio.SearchIO` uses. If you’ve worked with\n",
    "multiple sequence search tools, you might have had to deal with the many\n",
    "different ways each program deals with things like sequence coordinates.\n",
    "It might not have been a pleasant experience as these search tools\n",
    "usually have their own standards. For example, one tools might use\n",
    "one-based coordinates, while the other uses zero-based coordinates. Or,\n",
    "one program might reverse the start and end coordinates if the strand is\n",
    "minus, while others don’t. In short, these often creates unnecessary\n",
    "mess must be dealt with.\n",
    "\n",
    "We realize this problem ourselves and we intend to address it in\n",
    "`Bio.SearchIO`. After all, one of the goals of `Bio.SearchIO` is to\n",
    "create a common, easy to use interface to deal with various search\n",
    "output files. This means creating standards that extend beyond the\n",
    "object model you just saw.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you might complain, “Not another standard!”. Well, eventually we\n",
    "have to choose one convention or the other, so this is necessary. Plus,\n",
    "we’re not creating something entirely new here; just adopting a standard\n",
    "we think is best for a Python programmer (it is Biopython, after all).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three implicit standards that you can expect when working with\n",
    "`Bio.SearchIO`:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The first one pertains to sequence coordinates. In `Bio.SearchIO`,\n",
    "    all sequence coordinates follows Python’s coordinate style:\n",
    "    zero-based and half open. For example, if in a BLAST XML output file\n",
    "    the start and end coordinates of an HSP are 10 and 28, they would\n",
    "    become 9 and 28 in `Bio.SearchIO`. The start coordinate becomes 9\n",
    "    because Python indices start from zero, while the end coordinate\n",
    "    remains 28 as Python slices omit the last item in an interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The second is on sequence coordinate orders. In `Bio.SearchIO`,\n",
    "    start coordinates are always less than or equal to end coordinates.\n",
    "    This isn’t always the case with all sequence search tools, as some\n",
    "    of them have larger start coordinates when the sequence strand\n",
    "    is minus.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The last one is on strand and reading frame values. For strands,\n",
    "    there are only four valid choices: `1` (plus strand), `-1` (minus\n",
    "    strand), `0` (protein sequences), and `None` (no strand). For\n",
    "    reading frames, the valid choices are integers from `-3` to `3` and\n",
    "    `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these standards only exist in `Bio.SearchIO` objects. If you\n",
